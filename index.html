    <h2>Familiar World, New Territory</h2>
    <p>
        Following UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection’s PC release, we focused our efforts and learnings onto the PC
        version of The Last of Us Part I. Behind the scenes, we worked towards ensuring that The Last of Us Part I would
        be an authentic, satisfying experience for those playing on PC. The challenges we overcame and the successes we
        achieved in our previous modern PC release empowered us to dig into Part I’s PC development. New projects bring
        new challenges and opportunities alike.
    </p>

    <p>
        We were determined to do this right by preserving an experience so many love while delivering it to a new
        platform. From a technical perspective, Naughty Dog’s engine used for Part I was optimized for PS5. Moving it to
        PC meant a large amount of tuning, tweaking, and even re-thinking, especially when it came to how we utilized
        the GPU. We made careful decisions on how to adapt the overall experience for the PC.
    </p>
    <p>
        PC gaming gives a lot of personal freedom to players to customize their experience. As developers, we must
        ensure the experience is authentic across platforms while addressing the reality of differing hardware, even if
        we must reconsider fundamental aspects of a game. For example, The Last of Us Part I on PlayStation 5 employs
        “stick-walking,” where players traverse a space using the DualSense controller’s thumb stick. As we all know,
        walking too fast in The Last of Us might alert the Infected, which, if you’re trying to remain stealthy, you’ll
        want to avoid. But while using the thumb stick, players’ emotions might sometimes get the best of them,
        resulting in throttling the speed at which they walk. This feature is both tactile and emotional, adding to the
        suspense of any encounter. For the PC version, we had to consider many players’ preference of using a keyboard
        and mouse as a viable control method. However, they don’t necessarily behave the same way as a controller. So,
        the Design team explored and adapted this traversal method while still ensuring a world-class player experience
        with mouse and keyboard. We want PC players to experience the same level of tactile and suspenseful gameplay
        console players already enjoy.

    <p>
        These are only a few examples of the considerations and adjustments made for us to deliver The Last of Us Part I
        on PC. We knew every modification, whether a slight tweak or complete adaptation to the PC platform, made a big
        impact on players’ experiences. Developing for both platforms will also allow us to incorporate lessons learned
        from either platform into the overall way our games are designed and played.
    </p>
    <h2>A 10-Year Journey</h2>
    <p>
        PC may be a relatively newer platform for modern-day Naughty Dog, but this milestone is part of an almost
        decade-long journey for this beloved story. We originally released The Last of Us in 2013, introducing a new
        story, characters, and world to players globally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every developer contributed their talents and creativity, sometimes in moments of unexpected inspiration. I
        remember when we recorded our Animation Director and a concept artist acting as a survivor and a Clicker to
        demonstrate how they’d move and interact in-game. In this video, a survivor scavenges for food while a Clicker
        stalks him as prey. This demo was so suspenseful to watch! What was even more surreal is seeing this footage
        adapted by our talented teams into the in-game Clicker’s erratic, scary movement style that still scares all of
        us today. Whether we were handwriting (and, at times, hand-drawing) discoverable letters Joel and Ellie would
        find along their adventure or working together to craft fun and tense gameplay, we felt incredibly proud to
        contribute towards an experience that was a summation of our collective creativity and passion for games.
    </p>

         alt="game-image-3">
    <p>
        As development of the original The Last of Us neared its end, we played the completed game for the first time at
        our desks. We emailed back and forth, proud and emotional over this profoundly evocative experience we poured so
        much effort into creating. Nearly 10 years later, we are humbled how it resonates with so many of you, and it is
        surreal to see fans of every era celebrate the games and watch the HBO adaptation. Countless talented developers
        contributed to the world of The Last of Us over the years, and their contributions have brought us to this day.
        We are proud of the work we’ve done, both now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remaking The Last of Us Part I was an immense creative and technical undertaking. While the story remains
        timeless, we knew we could significantly modernize the original experience and showcase an even more vibrant
        world to explore. We remade Part I for PlayStation 5, using all our learnings from the past decade. We’re proud
        of how this version breathes fresh life into the original story, so returning players and new fans alike may
        experience Joel and Ellie’s journey with modern visuals and gameplay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we accomplished releasing the remake on PS5, we are thrilled to bring this game, not just to PC but for
        PC.

    <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
    <p>
        So, where will the next Naughty Dog development adventure take us? Rest assured, PlayStation and PC players,
        we’re already looking forward to sharing more, whether you prefer a DualSense controller or a keyboard and
        mouse. Developing for both platforms empowers us to incorporate lessons learned from either into the overall
        design of our games. Sharing our stories and experiences on PS5 as well as PC is something that Naughty Dog has
        embraced and will continue to support moving forward.
